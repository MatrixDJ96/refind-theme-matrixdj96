# rEFInd theme Regular

NOTE: this is a fork of [bobafetthotmail's repo](https://github.com/bobafetthotmail/refind-theme-regular) since he seems to have abandoned his project, he didn't answer to (my) PRs on github for years.

### Installation [Quick]:

1. Install **inkskape** and **optipng** in your linux system as they will be needed to process the icons.

2. Run the script `./render_bitmap.sh` in `./src` directory to process the svg files and generate the png files.
